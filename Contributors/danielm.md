Hi, I am Daniel.

I write python and some golang in my spare time and maintain a small blog.

This is a great way to practice some gitfoo before making contributions to
other repo's.


My github account is [danielmichaels](https://github.com/danielmichaels) 
and my blog is [here](https://danielms.site)
